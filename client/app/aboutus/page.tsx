        <h1 className="text-3xl"><b>About</b></h1>   
        <br></br>     
        <p>Welcome to RentEasy, A peer-to-peer marketplace to rent (almost) anything!
        Think of it as Airbnb for (almost) anything and everything!
        People owning idle assets like Camera, Bicycle, Projector can upload their products
        on our platform and people needing temporary access to these items can rent them out here. 
        In this way owner can earn passive income on their idle assets, and people needing temporary access 
        to these items wont need to buy them, instead just rent it out and save money.
        Founded by a passionate group of Cornell Tech students situated on the Roosevelt Island, 
        we're thrilled to introduce our first prototype with the main goal of fostering a community of sharing and accessibility.</p>

        <br></br>

        <h1 className="text-3xl"><b>How does it work?</b></h1>  
        <br></br>
        <p><b>Owner:</b> You have have an asset lying idle in your home eg. Camera, Bicycle, Projector, you can upload it on our platform for free. 
        Click on 'List New Item' on top right of the page to register as a owner and start listing your items. You will have to provide
        your WhatsApp number, Address and Email to register as a owner. If someone wishes to rent out the products that you have listed, you will
        be reached out by them, on your provided WhatsApp number.</p>
        <br></br>
       <p><b>Customer:</b> If you need temporary access to an asset eg. a DSLR Camera for a holiday trip, you can reach out to people in your neighborhood
        having those items, via our platform.</p>

        <br></br>

        <h1 className="text-3xl"><b>This is just a prototype</b></h1>
        <br></br>
        <p>You might be wondering, 'oh! what a crappy looking website without any features!' - we understand it!
        This is just our first prototype we have built with the only goal to gauge the product-market fit, validate our idea and talk to customers.
        As of now, we would are limiting to people only on Roosevelt island, we are not a registered company, we are not providing any protection, payment
        and delivery facilitation and are not responsible for any damage/loss incurred during the rent. We are aware that all of these things are crucial to
        build upon trust and we will implement it in the future.</p>
